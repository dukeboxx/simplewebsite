        <p><u><h3>What is a commit?</h3></u></p>
        <p>In git, a commit just refers to any time you edit, add or delete a file. All commits are logged so that everyone else who has access to the workflow know exactly what has been changed.</p>
        <p><u><h3>What is a branch?</h3></u></p>
        <p>The term branch refers to a separate version of your code that you can make changes and test things without editing the main version of your project.</p>
        <p><h3><u>What is a pull request?</u></h3></p>
        <p>A pull request is a way of submitting your work to the others working on the same proect for review and to get added to the main branch.</p>
        <p><h3><u>Additional information</u></h3></p>
        <p>Once a pull request has been submitted, you can deploy another branch to ensure everything works as intended before merging it with the main branch and creating your final product.</p>

        <p><h2><u>The Unix Shell</u></h2>The Unix shell is a command line interface (CLI) and a scripting language. This means that it allows users to directly input commands that the computer can interpret and execute.</p>
        <p><h3><u>How to list the files in the directory</u></h3></p> To list the files in a directory, you simply have to enter 'ls' in the Unix command prompt.
        <p><h3><u>How to show and change the working directory</u></h3></p> The working directory just refers to the directory you are currently in. To show the working directory you use the command 'pwd' in the Unix prompt. This stands for print current working directory<br> To change the working directory, you use the 'cd' command followed by the name of the directory you wish to change. To navigate to the home directory you can use 'cd ..'.
        <p><h3><u>How to create a new directory</u></h3></p> To create a new directory you use the command 'mkdir' followed by whatever you want to call this new directory.
        <p><h3><u>How to create and remove files</u></h3></p> To create a new file, you use the command 'touch'. <br> To delete a file, you use the command 'rm'.
        <p><h3><u>Test exercise</u></h3></p> To test your understanding of the commands we can do a little test. <br> <b><u>1)</u></b> Check that you are in your home directory. (If you're not in the home directory, use the correct command to navigate there). <br> <b><u>2)</u></b> Make a new directory called unixtest.<br> <b><u>3)</u></b> Change your working directory to unixtest.<br> <b><u>4)</u></b> Create a new directory inside it called 'test'.<br> <b><u>5)</u></b>Now go back to your home directory and confirm that you can navigate to and from your newly made files.
